# Changelog

## v1.0.9

- Update @actual-app/api to ^25.8.0

## v1.0.8

- **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Fixed API key authentication bypass issue where authentication hook was not applying to transaction routes due to Fastify plugin encapsulation
- Moved authentication hook from plugin-scoped context to global root level registration to ensure all routes are properly protected
- API requests without valid `X-API-KEY` header are now correctly rejected with 401 Unauthorized status

## v1.0.5

### Fixed
- Fixed 500 error when transactions were successfully added due to incorrect response format handling

## v1.0.4

### Fixed
- Case-insensitive API key header check in auth hook to properly handle different header capitalizations
- Improved transaction ID generation using UUID v4 to ensure uniqueness and prevent duplicate transaction issues
- Enhanced error logging for transaction results to provide more diagnostic information
